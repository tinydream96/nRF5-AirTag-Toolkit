# Configuration Directory

This directory is used to store:

- **Device Keys**: Generated key files (`*_keyfile`) for each AirTag.
- **Device Logs**: JSON logs of generated devices.
- **OpenOCD Config**: `openocd.cfg` for ST-Link/OpenOCD debugging.

**Note**: All key files and logs in this directory are ignored by git to protect private keys.
